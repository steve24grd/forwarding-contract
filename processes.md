# Forwarder and ForwarderFactory Smart Contracts: Process Explanation

## Forwarder Contract

1. Deployment:
   - The Forwarder contract is deployed with a specified pool address.
   - The constructor checks if the provided pool address is valid (not zero).
   - The pool address is stored as an immutable variable.

2. Receiving ETH:
   - The contract can receive ETH through two methods:
     a. Direct ETH transfers (handled by the `receive()` function)
     b. Transactions with data (handled by the `fallback()` function)

3. Forwarding ETH:
   - When ETH is received, the internal `_forward()` function is called.
   - The function checks if the received amount is greater than zero.
   - The ETH is then forwarded to the pool address using a low-level `call`.
   - If the forwarding is successful, a `Forwarded` event is emitted.

## ForwarderFactory Contract

1. Deployment:
   - The ForwarderFactory contract is deployed without any parameters.
   - It initializes an empty array to store deployed Forwarder contracts.

2. Creating a Forwarder:
   - Users call the `createForwarder()` function with a pool address.
   - A new Forwarder contract is deployed with the specified pool address.
   - The new Forwarder's address is added to the `forwarders` array.
   - A `ForwarderCreated` event is emitted with the new Forwarder's address and pool address.
   - The function returns the address of the newly created Forwarder.

3. Retrieving Forwarder Information:
   - Users can call `getForwardersCount()` to get the total number of deployed Forwarders.
   - Users can call `getForwarder(index)` to retrieve a specific Forwarder contract by its index in the array.

## Overall Process Flow

1. Deploy the ForwarderFactory contract.
2. Use the ForwarderFactory to create multiple Forwarder contracts, each with a specific pool address.
3. Send ETH to any of the created Forwarder contracts.
4. The Forwarder automatically forwards the received ETH to its designated pool address.
5. Track the created Forwarders and their activities using the ForwarderFactory contract and emitted events.

This setup allows for efficient management of multiple ETH forwarding contracts, each potentially linked to different pool addresses, while maintaining a centralized factory for deployment and tracking.
